# Crouchjump
A crouch-jump hotkey script for PUBG without having to rely on in-game bugs, autohotkey, or third-party keyboard/mouse drivers.

## End of Life
As of December 21st, 2017, this project has been deprecated due to PUBG's new vaulting mechanic which killed the mechanic that this script relied on abusing.

## Requirements
