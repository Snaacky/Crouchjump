# Crouchjump
A crouch-jump hotkey script for PUBG without having to rely on in-game bugs, autohotkey, and third-party mouse/keyboard drivers.

## Download
[You may click here to go to the download page.](https://github.com/Snaacky/Crouchjump/releases/tag/v1.0)

## Information
In the current state, Crouchjump requires you to have space bound to jump and C bound to crouch. If there is demand for it, I will add configuration options to the compiled version so you can set your binds freely.

## Warning
Crouchjump comes as is with no guarentees regarding potential bans. This program may technically violate the [rules of conduct](https://www.playbattlegrounds.com/rulesOfConduct.pu) however PlayerUnknown has no problem allowing players to violate his own rules of conduct, specifically the same rule that this project may violate [as I've written rather extensively about here](https://github.com/Snaacky/Crouchjump/issues/1). To add on to this, as far as I am aware, there have not been any bans issued for macros.

## Requirements (source code only)
* [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/)
* [keyboard](https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard)
* [pywin32](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/?source=navbar)
