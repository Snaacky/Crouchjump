# Crouchjump
A crouch-jump hotkey script for PUBG without having to rely on in-game bugs, autohotkey, and third-party mouse/keyboard drivers.

## Download
[You may click here to go to the download page.](https://github.com/Snaacky/Crouchjump/releases/tag/v1.0)

## Information
In the current state, Crouchjump requires you to have space bound to jump and C bound to crouch. If there is demand for it, I will add configuration options to the compiled version so you can set your binds freely.

## Warning
[poopieQueen](https://twitter.com/poopiequeen), community lead for PUBG, has stated [in her AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/72396a/iama_poopiequeen_ama/dnfg087/) that "at the moment" Bluehole are not banning users for macros so this should be safe to use. If there becomes a time in which it is unsafe, I will update this statement.

## Requirements (source code only)
* [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/)
* [keyboard](https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard)
